# MCS - Minecraft Script
### Overview

MCS - shorthand for "Minecraft Script" - is a new language, aimed to easily create powerful Minecraft Datapacks. MCS is both a language and a compiler. The compiler transform your scripts into a fully-fledged datapack.

### Values
The core values of the language are:
* **Simplicity**: MCS is easy to understand, for anyone already knowing Minecraft commands.
* **Readability**: MCS is based on Python's syntax, a language widely praised for its readability, and accessibility toward beginners.
* **Maintainability**: MCS different features were thought around best practices. They allow you to write [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) code, with a clear structure and a better file organization.
* **Speed**: A MCS script is way faster to write than Minecraft functions. You can reuse most parts of your code, and convenient features allow developers to code at a fast pace.
